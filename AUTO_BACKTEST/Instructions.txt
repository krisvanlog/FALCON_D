Run FalconDBacktestAutoLaunch

Each currency pair needs a settings .ini file and a pull from DevMT4 .bat file.

Both of these files need to be added to FalconBacktestAutoLaunch.bat



Results get pulled into Github/LazyTrade/Falcon_D/ts within folders named as currency pair tested


Run Y2016_SimulationFalconD R script. It pulls data from folders in Github/LazyTrade/Falcon_D/ts and outputs a nice visual analysis.
